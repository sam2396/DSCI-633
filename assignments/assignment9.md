## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Make sure your repo is up-to-date

Assignment codes might be modified during the semester so please pull from this repo first and overwrite your repo with the assignment9 folder. 

### Build your own Genetic Algorithm for tuning model parameters

#### Implement every function in [my_GA.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment9/my_GA.py)
Hint: check how [A9.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment9/A9.py) utilizes my_GA.py to tune my_DT learner.

### Test my_evaluation Algorithm with [A9.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment9/A9.py)

### Do not forget to push your local changes to the Github server.
 
 ## Grading Policy
 - importing additional packages such as sklearn is not allowed.
 - 4 (out of 7) points will be received if A9.py successfully runs and finds a parameter set.
 - The rest 3 points will be given based on the correctness of the implementation (TA will examine it manually).
