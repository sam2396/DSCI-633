## Evaluation

### Make sure your repo is up-to-date

Assignment codes might be modified during the semester so please pull from this repo first and overwrite your repo with the assignment8 folder. 

### Build your own evaluation methods

#### Implement every function in [my_evaluation.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment8/my_evaluation.py)
Hint: compute self.confusion once and use it to calculate other metrics (except for auc).

### Test my_evaluation Algorithm with [A8.py](https://github.com/hil-se/fds/blob/master/assignments/assignment8/A8.py)

### Do not forget to push your local changes to the Github server.

 
 ## Grading Policy
 - importing additional packages such as sklearn is not allowed.
 - 4 (out of 7) points will be received if A7.py successfully runs and evaluates the performance.
 - The rest 3 points will be given based on the percentage of the same performance metrics with the correct implementation.
